# Splitwise Backend Service Architecture

## Overview
The Splitwise Backend Service is a robust expense-sharing application that allows users to track shared expenses and balances with housemates, trips, groups, friends, and family. The system is designed with scalability, maintainability, and security in mind.

## System Architecture

### Components

1. **API Gateway**
   - Acts as the single entry point for all client requests
   - Handles routing, authentication, rate limiting, and request/response transformation
   - Implements circuit breakers for downstream service protection
   - Provides API documentation and versioning

2. **Splitwise Backend Service**
   - Core business logic implementation
   - Database interactions
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Activity logging
   - Payment processing

3. **Database**
   - PostgreSQL for persistent storage
   - Handles user data, expenses, groups, and transactions

### API Gateway Design

#### Responsibilities
1. **Request Routing**
   - Routes requests to appropriate backend services
   - Load balancing across multiple service instances
   - Path-based routing for different API versions

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - API key validation

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Per-user rate limiting
   - Per-IP rate limiting

4. **Request/Response Transformation**
   - Request validation
   - Response formatting
   - Error handling

5. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Request/response logging
   - Performance metrics
   - Error tracking
   - Usage analytics

#### Implementation Options
1. **Gateway**
   - Open-source API gateway
   - Plugin-based architecture
   - Built-in rate limiting and authentication

2. **Managed API Gateway**
   - Fully managed service
   - Serverless architecture
   - Built-in security features

3. **Custom Implementation**
   - Using Elixir/Phoenix
   - Full control over functionality
   - Tight integration with existing codebase
   - Custom monitoring and logging

## Design Approach

### 1. Microservices Architecture
- Service isolation for better scalability
- Independent deployment and scaling
- Technology stack flexibility
- Easier maintenance and updates

### 2. Event-Driven Design
- Asynchronous processing for better performance
- Loose coupling between services
- Better handling of peak loads
- Improved system resilience

### 3. Database Design
- Normalized schema for data integrity
- Efficient indexing for common queries
- Transaction support for data consistency

### 4. Security Measures
- API key authentication
- Rate limiting
- Input validation
- Data encryption
- Audit logging
